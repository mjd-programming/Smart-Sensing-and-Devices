## Project Title: Move-It Maze Game

### Group Number: 8
### Group Members: 
Sania Latif, Michael D'Arcy

### Sensors:
* Front facing camera
* Microphone
* Accelerometer/Gyroscope (Possibly)

### Abstract:
A reality exploratory maze game that can be used to entertain the player. The maze will be simulated and displayed on the phone with the user traversing based on their physical movement. This will be a mobile game used for excercise and entertainment. The front facing camera will be used to detect user movements whilst playing in the maze game and allow their physical behavior to be simulated in the game. The microphone will make the game acessable to users with any motary disabilities and allow them to verbally give directions in the game. The accelerometer or a gyroscope can also allow the user to play the game and provide additional necessary data for the game controls. 

### Senario: Targets
Currently users are facing being shut at home during Pandemic with exercising facilities shut down. To allow for a more entertaining exercise experience we created the Move-it Maze game. It can be played in any environment with only the user's physical behavior being simulated in the game. However, it is also accessible to be played with voice commands. In this game the physical movement of the user will simulate traversing through the maze to reach the end goal.
